# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Restaurant Inventory Tracker

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Creating an inventory tracker for a kitchen. Users will be able to add, remove, and edit quantities of various ingredients found in a kitchen (produce, cooking oil, meats, etc.) by weight, count, or volume.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Program will contain finite list of recipes; when a recipe is selected it will display the required ingredients and compare against current inventory. If current inventory does not meet required ingredients the program will notify the user of what ingredient and quantity needs to be purchased.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Arafat Hossain, arafat.hossain@temple.edu - TA Maryam Amr
Ryan Haney, TA Maryam Amr

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We would like to be able to keep a running total for the ingredients already in the kitchen. The ability to compare against & be affected by a collection of recipes would be added functionality.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Being able to accurately estimate the cost of whatever ingredients the user needs to buy for their recipe(s).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A clean GUI to make the tool more user friendly.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next, we'll learn about SQLite and create our first script to store ingredients in a database. I will research how to create tables and access data, while Arafat will decide how to organize our information.
